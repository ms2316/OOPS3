Task 1

Java Generics do not support the use of primitive types because java compiler casts parameterised types to "Object" class, which is impossible in case 
with primitives since primmitives do not extend Object class unlike other classes. Basically, at compile time compiler checks if a programmer has done bullshit,
like added to a generic List<Integer> an object of the other type. Assuming that there were not generics adding object of another type would be perfectly fine since 
add method accepts argument of type object(and since all classes are inherited from class object then this is fine). In the case with primitives this is not possible because
primitives simply cannot be casted to object class since they do not extend it.


Task 2



class Car extends Object {

}

class LinkedList {

  add(Object o) {
  
  }
}

list.add( (Object)car )
